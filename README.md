# Some Kind of Database

This project is written, because of studying file operations in C and object-oriented principles in C++ before the exam, by me. It is not my best style. It is not yet finished, I just bored and decided to push it here.

I placed the `test.cpp` there if anyone wants to test it and see the results with debugger.
